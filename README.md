# ACNH: Villager Simulator
Villager Simulator is an application for Animal Crossing: New Horizons for users to run a simulation of finding specific villagers utilizing the mystery islands or campsite method.

## Mystery Island
Island hopping determines the villager species first and then selects a random villager from that species. Villagers will repeat.

## Campsite Method
The campsite method has a 60% chance of rolling for a villager personality type that your island is missing, while the other 40% is divided between the rest of the personalities. Campers do not repeat unless you have seen all of them or if you time travel backwards (which restarts the whole process). The campsite will also prioritze villagers that you haven't invited onto your island before.
